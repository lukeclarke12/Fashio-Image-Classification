# Fashion-Image-Classification
The goal of this project was to identify articles of clothing in an image.

Here I trained an image classification algorithm to identify clothing articles with the following output labels:

Dress  - 0
Jacket - 1
Jeans  - 2
Blouse - 3
Skirt  - 4
Shorts - 5

The resulting algorithm can predict with an accuracy score between 60% - 80% across classes with images that have little noise. This algorithm is a quick first attempt for a larger project.
